# Confusify
Create a similar, usually less-readable phrase from an input phrase, replacing default characters with "confusable" ones according to the Unicode Consortium

Try it: https://dinoosauro.github.io/Confusify/
## How it works
Unicode has published [a list of characters that might be similar to another ones](http://www.unicode.org/Public/security/latest/confusables.txt). I put that list in a JSON file ([click here to create your own one](https://dinoosauro.github.io/Confusify/createList.html)) and made this kinda ugly website to that users can try to create similar text. Sometimes the result is great, sometimes it's really strange.

The user can also decide to add invisible characters (even if it's a bit bugged) or if they want to enable characters that aren't displayed correctly on webpages from the settings (click on the icon at the top right of the page).

### Example
I post here an image with some _example text that we can all agree on_

## Disclaimer
This tool was made just for fun, and must not be used for spam or other dangerous activities. Use this tool just for curiosity and to create some more _exotic_ phrases, but don't ruin it by using it the wrong way (btw lots of YouTube bots do this from lots of time, so I don't think they need this tool, and probably no one will ever see this)
